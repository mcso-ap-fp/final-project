Keeping track of info required for project write up here:
https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/371M/hw/writeup.html


Make sure your report specifies the following items, but bear in mind that the report is just your chance to convince me that you did a good job. 
Include what you think is necessary to convince me of that fact. 
I love hearing about debugging war stories. I'm serious, it is a problem for me.

## Title 
Report the title of your app

## Description
Our app is designed to help individuals or groups decide on a location to eat based on their dining preferences. The goal is to please the most members of the group while avoiding the “I don’t care you pick” circular conversation. We will utilize the output of a recommendation algorithm as input to the Google Maps API to display details of the best nearby restaurants. 
 
## Screenshot
Include a screenshot of your app, hopefully one that illustrates key functionality.

## API(s)
List the APIs your app uses, for example Google maps. 
Also let me know if you use certain Android features extensively like animation or you have custom controllers (navigation drawer, action bar, etc.).

## Libraries
List all third party libraries you use, and what they do for your app (each in their own paragraph). 
Describe briefly what was good and/or challenging about using them.

## Services
List all third party services you use, and what they do for your app (each in their own paragraph). 
Describe briefly what was good and/or challenging about using them.

## UI/UX
Discuss anything noteworthy about your UI/UX/display code.

## Back End
Discuss anything noteworthy about your back end or processing logic.

## Learnings / Challenges 
Discuss the most important or interesting thing you learned doing your project.
Discuss the most difficult challenge you overcame and/or your most interesting debugging story.

## Local Setup
If necessary, briefly tell us how to build and run your project. Include details about how to set back end services (if you use them). 
In the common case, we will rely on your demo, but just in case we have an issue, we'd like some tips.

## Database Schema
If you use firebase, include a screenshot of your database schema. 
The schema is basically the structure and the type information. 
So print out the keys and values and the types for any important data you have in the database.

## Lines of Code

Report the count of lines of code in your project. Use cloc (http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) to count the lines. Run this command on your code.
cloc -by-file-by-lang app/src/main/
Report the total Java and total XML lines that you wrote. Do not include boilerplate lines, external libraries, or other sources in the total of lines on which you claim authorship.
Indicate how you calculate how many lines you authored if you report line totals. Maybe use a table.
You can break down the lines into modules if you think that helps, but I'm most interested in the totals of code you wrote.

## Code Frequency Graph (if available)
We want you to include the code frequency graph that github gives you for your repository. 
Open your project's github page in a web browser. Click the "Insights" tab. 
Then click the "Code frequency" tab on the menu bar on the left. You will see the "Code frequency" graph. 
Put a screen shot of your code frequency figure into your writeup. Here is an example figure for reference. 
If you don't have a pro account, or can't provide this data, that is ok.
